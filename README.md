SteamZL - Steam Manifest & Lua Generator
What is this?

SteamZL is a free tool that helps you generate Steam manifest and Lua files. It's made for anyone who wants to work with Steam game files, create offline libraries, or manage DLC content.

Why would you use it?

If you're working with Steam emulators like Goldberg or SmartSteamLoader, you need manifest files (.acf) and Lua scripts to tell Steam which games are installed. Instead of creating these files manually, SteamZL does it for you automatically. Just enter the App ID and download a ZIP with everything you need.

The cool stuff:

Generate one game or a bunch at once

Create DLC loaders to unlock additional content

Everything downloads as neat ZIP files

Test mode to try it out without any real data

Full guide on how to use it

Beautiful purple interface with snow falling

All runs in your browser - no installation needed

Completely open source and transparent

How does it work?

You enter a Steam App ID (like 730 for Counter-Strike), click generate, and you get a ZIP file with your manifest and Lua files ready to use with Steam emulators.

Fair warning: This only works offline. If you try online multiplayer, you'll get caught by anti-cheat systems. Use it for single-player games only.
